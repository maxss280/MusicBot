## Contributing
Pull requests and issues are welcome. However, please note that any pull request that rewrites large amounts of code without any explanation will be closed, and pull requests must target the `review` branch, which is the latest developmental branch, as a base branch.

### Branch Policy
- **`master`**: Active development - may be unstable
- **`Stable-1.0.0`**: Production release - only critical fixes
- **`review`**: Development branch for newer features
- **`dev`**: Feature branch for upcoming changes

For production deployments, use the `Stable-1.0.0` branch. For development and testing new features, use the `master` branch (with caution).

### What we want
* Bug and typo fixes
* Improvements to existing code
* New features

### What we don't want
* Translations
* Vanity changes to text or the appearance of the bot
* Anything that requires unnecessary additional dependencies without justification
