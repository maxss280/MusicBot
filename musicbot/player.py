# if redistributing ffmpeg is an issue, it can be downloaded from here:

# Extracting bin/ffmpeg.exe, bin/ffplay.exe, and bin/ffprobe.exe should be fine
# However, the files are in 7z format so meh
# I don't know if we can even do this for the user, at most we open it in the browser
# I can't imagine the user is so incompetent that they can't pull 3 files out of it...
# ...
# ...right?

# Get duration with ffprobe
#   ffprobe.exe -v error -show_entries format=duration -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 -sexagesimal filename.mp3
# This is also how I fix the format checking issue for now
# ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_format stream

# Normalization filter
# -af dynaudnorm
